    Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs,
    Even though checkered by failure... than to rank with those poor spirits
    Who neither enjoy nor suffer much, because they live in a gray twilight
    That knows not victory nor defeat.
                                                  — Theodore Roosevelt

          <h2>Hey, nice to meet you!</h2>
          <p>I’m Sean Kirmani &lt;sean@kirmani.io&gt;, a roboticist, researcher, scientist, and student. I’m 24 years old — that’s 8800 days to be exact!</p>
          <p>I interned at X working on robot perception in Summer 2017 and will be returning full-time after graduation. Previously, I’ve worked on image-based lighting for augmented reality with the Project Tango team at Google VR/AR.</p>
          <p>I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I spent four years as a robotics research assistant with various professors in the Robotics Lab at UT Austin. I have experience in behavior architectures, perception, planning, navigation, manipulation, and machine learning.</p>
          <p>I enjoy working on all things robotics — with a bent towards robot learning. I’m most interested about perceptually-driven approachs to controls, so that the boundaries between perception, navigation, and manipulation blur together. Most of all, I’m interested in using this understanding to make robots seem a little less “robotic”. A summary of my technical interests are below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Robot Learning</li>
            <li>3D Computer Vision</li>
            <li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
            <li>Neural Networks</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
            <li>Human–Robot Interaction</li>
          </ul>
          <p>My <a href="/resume.html">résumé</a> is available if you want to be all, like, formal and stuff, dude.</p>
